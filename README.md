# Image-Classification
We present our approach for building classification models on the given data that has 90,000 training samples belonging to 200 classes, 
each class having 450 training samples. Each training sample is a 64*64*3 (RGB) image. The validation set consists of 10,000 samples
and the testing set consist of another 10,000 samples. It is to design the best model that categorize the 10,000 testing images.
